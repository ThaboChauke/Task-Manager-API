# Task Manager API

This project is a RESTful API for managing user tasks, built with Flask. The API supports user registration, login, and task management features, including task creation, viewing, updating, and deletion. User authentication is handled via JWT tokens, ensuring secure access to protected endpoints.

## Features

- **User RegistrationTask Management API and Login**: Users can register and log in to obtain a JWT token.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secures task management routes, allowing only authenticated users to access their data.
- **Task Management**: Create, view, update, and delete tasks with due dates.

## Endpoints
- Detailed endpoint documentation can be found in the [endpoints.md](endpoints.md) file.

- **`/register`** (`POST`): Register a new user.
- **`/login`** (`POST`): Log in a user and receive a JWT token.
- **`/tasks`**:
  - **`POST`**: Create a new task (JWT-protected).
  - **`GET`**: Fetch tasks for the authenticated user (coming soon).
  - **`PUT`**: Update an existing task (coming soon).
  - **`DELETE`**: Delete a task (coming soon).
